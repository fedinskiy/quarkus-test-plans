# QUARKUS-2349 - Fully support Java 17 and drop Java 11 for Native application

JIRA link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QUARKUS-2349

Mandrel JDK17 native builder image becomes the default supported image in order to compile Quarkus native applications.

## Related test plans

 - [QUARKUS-728](QUARKUS-728.md)
 - [QUARKUS-1397](QUARKUS-1397.md)

## Scope of the testing

Test development will focus on
- Upstream we run both Mandrel and GraalVM in some cases, in downstream we use Mandrel only
- Current native scenarios will be generated by GraalVM and Mandrel JDK17 native builder images
- GraalVM and Mandrel JDK11 must be deprecated (and removed) from all pipelines
- Product documentation need to be updated as well and remove old JDK references to Java 11
    - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QUARKUS-2347
  
### Impact on testsuites and testing automation:

- GraalVM/Mandrel JDK17 native builder images are going to be used to compile Quarkus native application regardless of whether the application runs on java 11 or 17
- Native daily GitHub builds will cover GraalVM and Mandrel community JDK17 native builder images
-  `ubi-quarkus-native-image:22.2-java17` and `ubi-quarkus-mandrel:22.2-java17` now
-  targeting `ubi-quarkus-native-image:22.3-java17` and `ubi-quarkus-mandrel:22.3-java17` (when available) for Quarkus 2.13.z releases.

## Getting familiar with the feature
Following actions were taken to ensure familiarity:
 - Exploratory testing, for example OCP native scenarios 
 - Ensure correctness and availability of the images

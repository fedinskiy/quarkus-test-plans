# QQE-343- Quarkus and non-JSON payload in REST endpoints

JIRA: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QQE-343
PR: https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/pull/1599

## Scope of the testing
The test scope includes validating Quarkus's capability to handle non-JSON payloads in REST endpoints.
For this testing scope I will choose some of them, for instance XML, YAML and images. 
Tests will cover both JVM and Native mode executions.
#### Test scenarios

        1. XML Payload Scenario:
            * Verify the endpoint's ability to consume and produce XML payloads.
            * Send a request with an XML payload to the endpoint.
            * Validate the response, ensuring it matches the expected XML Schema.
    
        2. YAML Payload Scenario:
            * Check the endpoint's ability to return payload from a YAML file.
            * Send a request with a YAML payload from a file to an endpoint.
            * Validate the response, ensuring it matches the expected YAML content.
    
        3. Image Payload Scenario:
            * Verify the endpoint's ability to return an image by making a GET request.
            * Send an image in a multipart form to the endpoint.
            * Check the endpoint's handling of image upload as part of a multipart form by making a POST request.
### Impact on testsuites and testing automation:
New tests will be added inside [http/http-advance-reactive](https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/tree/main/http/http-advanced-reactive) module.

### Impact on resources:
After the new test classes introduced in http/http-advanced-reactive module the execution in JVM was only increased by seconds:

`````[INFO] Quarkus QE TS: HTTP: advanced-reactive ............. SUCCESS [03:07 min]`````

(result from https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/actions/runs/7673741087/job/20917606017?pr=1599).

## Getting familiar with the feature

Following actions were taken to ensure familiarity:
- Experiment with Quarkus REST functionalities for providing and consuming non-JSON payload (XML, YAML, images)
- Take a look and understand the Quarkus REST guides related to.


##  Future considerations
To handle YAML files, it was necessary to create a YAML Provider that implements MessageBodyReader and MessageBodyWriter to map the DTO used,
enabling the serialization and deserialization of YAML data for the DTO (CityListDTO).
Essentially, MessageBodyReader/MessageBodyWriter allows for the conversion of YAML streams into Java objects and vice versa.
See [YamlProvider class](https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/blob/main/http/http-advanced-reactive/src/main/java/io/quarkus/ts/http/advanced/reactive/YamlProvider.java) for more details.

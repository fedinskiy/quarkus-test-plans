# QQE-378 - HTTP module / REST use-cases - Development topic compression Brotli4j

Jira : [QQE-378](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QQE-378)

PR:  TODO
## Scope of the testing
Within the Quarkus framework, we have the option to leverage various compression strategies, including Gzip, Snappy, and Brotli4j. 
Notably, Brotli4J, being a part of Vert.x, is inherently supported by Quarkus.

Given the absence of existing test coverage for Brotli4J within this context,
we have identified a need to encompass this area within our testing scope.
 - Test whether Brotli4J compression library functions correctly within Quarkus, particularly in the context of REST endpoints using the Quarkus REST extension.
 - The test coverage will be for JVM, native mode and Openshift.
 - To use Brotli4J in quarkus compression we will need:
   * Utilize Vert.x http server options  to add Brotli4J compressor support.   
   * Ensure that the server is configured to respect the Accept-Encoding header of `br` to automatically
     compress the response body with Brotli4j compression and send it back to the client.
### Test scenarios 

- Compression Enabled, Response Compressed and Decompressed
   *    Set up a Quarkus application with the Brotli4J compression library.
   *    Enable quarkus http configuration compression `quarkus.http.enable-compression=true`.
   *    The response is compressed if the Content-Type header is set and the value is a compressed media type as configured specification in the next point.
   *    Specify the media types supported to compress `quarkus.http.compress-media-types`.  
   *    Note that the REST extension also make it possible to enable/disable compression declaratively using the annotations `io.quarkus.vertx.http.Compressed` and `io.quarkus.vertx.http.UnCompressed`.
   *    Add the Brotli compressor using `.addCompressor(io.netty.handler.codec.compression.StandardCompressionOptions.brotli())`.
   *    Send a request to a REST endpoint with the `.header("Accept-Encoding", "br")` and verify that the response is compressed using Brotli.
   *    Verify for decompression, that we can use `quarkus.http.enable-decompression` when is it enabled, vert.x will decompress the request’s body if it’s compressed.
- Compression Disabled, Response Not Compressed (Uncompressed)
    *   Disable quarkus http configuration compression `quarkus.http.enable-compression=false`.
    *   Send a request to a REST endpoint and verify that the response is not compressed.
    *   The resource method is never compressed if is annotated with `@io.quarkus.vertx.http.Uncompressed`.
- JSON Payloads, Compression Works up to 8192 bytes
    *   Create a JSON payload of varying sizes up to 8192 bytes.
    *   Send a request to a REST endpoint with the JSON payload and verify that the response is compressed
  using Brotli.
    * Create a JSON payload of more of 8192 bytes and check the error.
-  Different Media Types, Compression Applied Correctly 
     *   Create a plain text payload.
     *   Create an XML payload.
     *   Send a request to a REST endpoint with each payload and verify that the response is compressed using Brotli4J.

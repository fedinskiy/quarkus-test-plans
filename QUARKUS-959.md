# Quarkus-959 - Improved Developer Joy with DevServices

JIRA link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QUARKUS-959

The goal is to verify proper functionality of the Quarkus DevServices

## Scope of the testing
Test development will focus on  
 - Extend CRUD test cases with applications that spin up the database dev services. Relational databases for which we have supported extensions:
   - PostgreSQL
   - MariaDB
   - MySQL
   - MSSQL
 - Cover "DB schema evolution" tools as Quarkus-flyway. If there is any conflict at the start-time, the error should be logged in a way that could understandable by the developer and fix it.
 - Extend messaging test cases with applications that spin up messaging dev services. Messaging services for which we have supported extensions:
   - AMQP: quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-amq
   - Kafka: RedPanda
 - Use the existing dev mode test coverage to ensure that running scenarios without dev services is still possible
 - Cover DEV UI
 - Quarkus app is waiting for the necessary services to start, developer must be informed about started services progress
 - DevsServices will be disabled in prod mode and enabled by default in test or dev mode
 - Validate several configuration properties:
   - quarkus.kafka.devservices.enabled: Kafka dev services is enabled by default unless kafka.bootstrap.servers is set or if all the Reactive Messaging Kafka channel are configured with a bootstrap.servers. If you set this property to false, then kafka dev services will be disabled in all the cases. 
   - quarkus.datasource.devservices.enabled: datasource dev services is enabled by default unless there is an existing configuration present. If you set this property to false, then datasource dev services will be disabled in all the cases. 
   - quarkus.datasource.devservices.port: Optional fixed port the dev service will listen to. If not defined, the port will be chosen randomly.


### Impact on testsuites and testing automation:
 - Enhance Quarkus QE test framework to cover all the features that are part of the scope
 - Add test coverage into the Quarkus QE test suite only for baremetal
 - Ensure this coverage works both in JVM and NATIVE mode 
 - Make sure the service is started just once and not respinned multiple times
 - The startup time will be increased, so must be clear from a developerâ€™s point of view that Quarkus app is waiting for the necessary services to start. 
 - A developer must be able to run test with dev-services enabled and also run the same service in dev mode. Both services (test + dev-services and quarkus dev-mode + dev-services) must be not interfere with each other.
 - Developers must be able to develop his services following a continuos testing approach 
 - Ensure that the user is notified if there is no Docker installed
 - Run some tests in resources restricted environment. If the services are unable to boot (e.g. kafka) there should be some warning to the end users. 

## Getting familiar with the feature
Following actions were taken to ensure familiarity:
 - Focus on exploratory testing of the features
 - Ensure good user experience and simplicity of use

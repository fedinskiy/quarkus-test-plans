# QQE-377- HTTP/2 test use cases for Rest endpoints

JIRA: http://issues.redhat.com/browse/QQE-376
PR: https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/pull/1655

## Scope of the testing
The scope of this test plan encompasses the development and execution of HTTP/2 test cases for REST endpoints using the Quarkus REST extension.
and Vert.x HttpClient within the Quarkus Test Suite.
#### Test scenarios
  1. HttpClient Vertx Compatibility HTTP/1.1 Test:
        * Verify that the HttpClient functions correctly with HTTP/1.1.
        * Ensure that the response status code is OK and the version is HTTP/1.1.
        * Confirm the presence of the expected response body containing the text expected.

  2. HttpClient Vertx HTTP/2 Protocol Test with SSL, ALPN:
        * Verify the HttpClient's compatibility with HTTP/2 protocol.
        * Ensure that the HttpClient is configured with SSL, ALPN, TrustAll set to true, and VerifyHost set to false.
        * Confirm that the response status code is OK and the version is HTTP/2.
        * Assert the presence of the expected response body containing the greeting.

  3. HTTP/2 Protocol Test:
        * Verify the HttpClient's compatibility with HTTP/2 protocol.
        * Confirm that the response status code is OK and the version is HTTP/2.
        * Assert the presence of the expected response body containing the text expected.

  4.  Test Max Header Size Exceeded: 
        * Verify the appropriate error message is returned when the maximum header size is exceeded using HTTP/2.
        * Generate headers to exceed the configured limit.
        * Ensure that the error message indicates header size exceeded the maximum allowed size.

  5. Verify X-Content-Type-Options Header:
       * Verify that the X-Content-Type-Options header is correctly set to "nosniff" in the HTTP/2 response headers.
       * Confirm that the response status code is OK and the version is HTTP/2.
       * Assert the presence of the X-Content-Type-Options header with the expected value.

  6. Test Sending and Receiving Custom Frames over HTTP/2:
      * Verify the capability to send and receive custom frames over HTTP/2.
      * Confirm that the response contains the expected custom frame data.
      * Assert the correctness of the received custom frame data.

### Impact on testsuites and testing automation:
New tests will be added inside [http/http-advance-reactive](https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/tree/main/http/http-advanced-reactive) module.

### Impact on resources:
After the new test classes introduced in http/http-advanced-reactive module the execution in JVM was only increased by seconds:

`````[INFO] Quarkus QE TS: HTTP: advanced-reactive ............. SUCCESS [03:07 min]`````

(result from https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/actions/runs/7673741087/job/20917606017?pr=1599).

## Getting familiar with the feature

To ensure familiarity with the feature, the following actions were taken:

  * Thorough research on HTTP/2 specifications of Quarkus REST guides.
  * Analysis of existing test suites and use cases for REST clients in Quarkus.

## Considerations
OpenShift Serverless supports only insecure or edge-terminated routes.

Insecure or edge-terminated routes do not support HTTP2 on the OpenShift Container Platform. These routes also do not support gRPC because gRPC is transported by HTTP2

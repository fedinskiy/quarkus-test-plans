# QUARKUS-2072 - Defined boundaries for supported dependencies in RHBQ

JIRA link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/QUARKUS-2072

There are discussions within and outside the RHBQ team about the set of artifacts that should be productized.

This effort aims to define a programmatic way to list supported extensions and their dependencies to define the boundaries for productization effort.

## Scope of the testing
- Get familiar with the tool
- Review generated list of artifacts
- Compare generated list against released bits
- Adjust configuration of the tool to include and exclude artifacts
- Ensure list of artifacts gets generated by productization team
- Ensure list of artifacts gets uploaded together with testing bits
- Adjust Marete checks according to generated list of artifacts
- Adjust StartStopTS checks according to generated list of artifacts
- Test development in case of missing test coverage

### Impact on test suites and testing automation
A lot of effort to be invested into review and comparison with previous RHBQ build. 

Automation steps:
 - Enhance acceptance pipeline to ensure availability of the list of artifacts
- If possible enhance Marete to take leverage of the generated list
- If possible enhance StartStopTS to take leverage of the generated list
 - Ensure acceptance a general testing pipeline can be executed with the newly defined maven repo 

## Automated test development
- Enhancements of Marete and StartStopTS as mentioned above

## Advanced topics for test development
